                    <h1>Overview of the topic.......</h1>
                    <h2>Firstly we will talk about how these laws came into existence or to be precise how they were discovered NOT invented.</h2>
                    <p id="para">Sir Isaac Newton worked in many areas of mathematics and physics. He developed the theories of gravitation in 1666 when he was only 23 years old. In 1686, he presented his three laws of motion in the 
                        <br>“Principia Mathematica Philosophiae Naturalis.”
                        <br>
                        <br>By developing his three laws of motion, Newton revolutionized science.
                        Newton’s laws together with Kepler’s Laws explained why planets move in elliptical orbits rather than in circles.</p>
