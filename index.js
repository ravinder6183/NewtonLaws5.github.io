However, when you apply more force and overcome its inertia, it moves. The greater the mass, the greater the inertia.        <br>        Inertia is DIRECTLY proportional to mass.        That is why heavy objects are difficult to move.        <br>        Similarly, a moving object doesn’t stop instantly.
